         <h2>About Me</h2>
         <p>
            I'm a versatile professional with a background in 
            business administration, law, and data analytics. I'm a Georgia native, 
            but have lived in BHAM and NYC too.
            I graduated with both a JD and an MBA from Samford University.
            I've developed a strong foundation in critical thinking, problem-solving, 
            and data-driven decision-making. 
         </p>
         <p>
         Currently, I leverage my skills focusing on optimizing data processes and 
         enhancing efficiency. I have a passion for continuous learning and innovation. 
         In my freetime, I enjoy exploring with my Maltipom, Pepper, 
         and immersing myself in a good book.
